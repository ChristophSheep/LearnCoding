Learn Coding
------------

About
-----
Learn Coding is a collection of things I found important over the year


Features
--------
The basic features of are:

- Keep it simple as possible
- Readable AND clean AND fast code is possible

Patterns
--------
Good old pattern (from the Gang of Four(GOF)) open your mind to think like an engineer and not like a computer programming hacker.
Niklas Wirth complained in his article google://"A Plea for Lean Software"

- MVP 
- Command
- Observer

Problem is young pride
----------------------
If you are young you are a hacker. You are open to see cool stuff. But later you will see
by experience if it was really cool or not (a trap).

- 2.Tim 2:22 says: "Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."

Good tutorial/example
---------------------
It is not easy to find really good tutorials and example that hold in bigger programs.
It is easy to make a simple small example but will it hold if big pratical apps under
stress and haveing no time.

Good tutorial should be a good in giving a

- Maya API (C, C++) - http://docs.autodesk.com/MAYAUL/2014/ENU/Maya-API-Documentation/

Bad tutorial
------------
What it the biggest problem with example. If you are young you do not know to code. So
you look at the website in your ide and find their example. But this examples are only
short example to see what a class or method to. 

BUT PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS AS YOUNG DEVELOPER - > THIS LEADS TO MESS IN BIGGER PRORGAMS

For instance when I start to program I loved the msdn because there are example and long
description compared to a simple doxygen class generated api docu.

- MSDN - It seems they are written by know technical persons you only
- JavaDoc - No examples

What is better no example or half quality examples. I believe no examples are much butter,
when they do not lead onto the wrong trail that end is messy code.
